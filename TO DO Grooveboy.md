# TO DO Grooveboy

- ~~User experience~~
  - ~~Turn notes off on new tracker.~~
  - ~~Turn notes on on change.~~
- Finish channel 3 and 4 sound.
  - ~~Channel 3: set to generic wave. Experiment with forms.~~
  - Channel 4:
    - Edit screen UI change for drums.
    - Tracker data structure changes for drums. How will three percussives play on one sound channel?
- Clean up. Remove kinks for first POC release.
  - ~~Polyrhythms~~
    1. ~~Step keeps counting up to #notes * LCM.~~
    2. ~~Every time step modulo rhythm equals zero for a certain pattern,~~
       ~~trigger the step divided by rhythm step of that pattern.~~
  - ~~Play/Pauze/Stop~~
  - ~~Cursor path between Amplitude and Wave Settings.~~
  - ~~Cursor moves too fast.~~
  - Channel 3 attributes don't seem to do anything. Do the other attributes work fine?
  - ~~When changing length while notes are enabled, the notes length seems to impact the pattern notes.~~
- Documentation / Manual
- ~~Github workflows.~~
  - ~~Action to build grooveboy.~~
  - ~~Only branches that succeed on that action may be merged into master.~~
  - ~~Nothing may directly be pushed to master.~~
  - ~~Merges to master must be done through a PR.~~
